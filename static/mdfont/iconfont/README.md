# Repository will not be updated for a few months
Developement is still being done and early releases will still be avalible, source code will be UPDATED only after big features are added and trailer is created. 

I strongly recommend against making pull requests to the code as this major update will cause annoying merge conflicts. 

The recommended way to use the Material Icons font is by linking to the web font hosted on Google Fonts:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
      rel="stylesheet">
```
